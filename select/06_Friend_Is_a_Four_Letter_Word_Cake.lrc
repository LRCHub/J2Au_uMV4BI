[00:14.22] To me
[00:16.08] Coming from you
[00:18.88] Friend is a four letter word
[00:24.90] End is the only part of the word
[00:31.34] That I heard.
[00:33.10] Call me morbid or absurd
[00:36.77] But to me
[00:40.36] Coming from you
[00:44.47] Friend is a four letter word
[00:58.47] 
[01:20.97] To me
[01:22.13] Coming from you
[01:24.70] Friend is a four letter word
[01:30.73] End is the only part of the word
[01:36.70] That I heard
[01:38.62] Call me morbid or absurd
[01:42.03] But to me
[01:45.54] Coming from you
[01:53.04] 
[01:49.84] Friend is a four letter word
[02:03.84] 
[01:56.41] When I go fishing for the words
[01:59.96] I am wishing you would say to me
[02:03.78] I am really only praying that
[02:18.28] 
[02:07.76] The words you'll soon be saying
[02:11.09] Might betray the way you feel about me.
[03:01.57] But to me
[03:04.25] Coming from you
[03:09.38] Friend is a four letter word.
