I thought I knew you, it only goes to show that I was wrong
So wrong
I see right through you
And everything we used to have is gone, it's all gone
You said you loved me
But did you mean a word of what you said?
When you said
You're thinking of me
I'm sure that someone else was in your bed, getting head

I'll tell you what, love is just a four letter word
Like it or not, love is just a four letter word

You say it's over and treat me like you don't know who I am
Who I am
I hope you know girl
That you've turned me into a broken man, That's all I am
And then you tell me
Tell me that you've found somebody new
Well good for you
But do you really, think I care about the things you do?
Fuck both of you

I'll tell you what, love is just a four letter word
Like it or not, love is just a four letter word

So now you've left me, I bet that you could hardly even wait
I used to love you, now you're just the girl I love to hate
All I can say is, I wish I'd listened to my own advice
I learned the hard way, that you were cold as ice

So thanks a lot, love is just a four letter word
Like it or not, love is just a four letter word
I'll tell you what, love is just a four letter word
Love is just a four letter word
Love is just a four letter word
Love is just a four letter word
