Sleepwalk away the life
if that turns you on
It's only a moment
look away and it's gone
It's about time that your mind
took a holiday
You're all grown up
don't you ever wanna play
You've had enough
Staring out of those
dead end eyes
It's gonna be tough
The battle's on and
there's always a prize
I don't know
what it is I'm feeling
A four letter word really
gets my meaning
Nothing ever lasts forever
<♪>
Get on your feeling
going out of your mind
The wheel needs to roll
the clock on the wall says
it's time
Call it love
call it whatever you please
It's not what you want
it might be just what you need
You've had enough
It feels like
you've blown a 50 amp fuse
It's gonna be tough
The more you have the
more you can loose
I don't know what it is
I'm feeling
A four letter word really
gets my meaning
Nothing ever lasts forever
You've had enough
Staring out of those
dead end eyes
It's gonna be tough
The battle's on and
there's always a prize
I don't know what it is
I'm feeling
A four letter word really
gets my meaning
Nothing ever lasts forever
Nothing ever lasts forever
Nothing ever lasts forever
Nothing ever lasts forever
