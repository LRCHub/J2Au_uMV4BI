(Difford/Tilbrook)

(One of a hundred...)
I wonder if she'll bury my love
So no one else will find
A heart that has been broken
A hundred or more times
And when she gets up to wander
I watch her as she goes
Our eyes meeting for a second
But only she will know

Love's a four letter story
I thought I'd made you see
Turns out that I'm just loving
A girl that used to be
Just one of a hundred heartaches
So long sweet misery

I listen to the things she's saying
Agreeing all the time
These painful words forever
Will prey upon my mind
And when she gets up to wander
I wonder if she knows
Of each and every heartache
That comes as lovers go

(One of a hundred heartaches...)

I wonder if she'll bury my love
Now I deserve to cry
I listen to the things she's saying
Agreeing all the time
And when she gets up I wonder
If this is really true
I guess there'll never be another
Another love won't do
